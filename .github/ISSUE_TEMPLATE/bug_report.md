Hi,

**Description**

- What I am trying to do?
- What's wrong?
- Do I have a workaround to share?

**Environment**
 
- OS: [e.g. Ubuntu 18.04.1, Windows 10 Pro, Mac OS X]
- JDK: [e.g. Oracle JDK 11 64 bits]
- Gradle: [e.g. Gradle 6.8]
- Frontend Gradle plugin: [e.g. 5.3.0 JDK 8]

Settings in `build.gradle[.kts]` file:
```groovy
frontend {
    // Provide the plugin settings applied.
}
```

**Attachments**
Additionally, you may attach Gradle log file, screenshots, sample archive, JUnit test case to help reproducing the issue.
